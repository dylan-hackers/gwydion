To install a precompiled binary distribution of Gwydion, go to
http://www.opendylan.org/downloading.phtml and download an appropriate
package for your operating system. Tarballs are available for several
common Unix-like systems and a variety of processors. RPMs and other
"packaged" binaries are slowly becoming available as well.

Binary tarballs are currently designed to untar into /usr/local on most
platforms. If you want to put them somewhere else, please see the section
on relocating binaries below. "Packaged" binaries such as RPMs install
wherever convention would have them install, and need no tweaking.

To install a source distribution, you'll first probably want to
install a binary distribution. This is because large parts of Gwydion
Dylan are written in Dylan and the bootstrap process is fairly time
consuming. (If you only want to install Mindy, you don't need the
binary distribution. Just pass the option '--disable-d2c' to
configure.)

Recent versions of d2c require a preinstalled Boehm-Weiser-Demers
garbage collection library. The sources of libgc used to be part of
the distribution, but we chose to remove it in favor of the real
thing.  Your operating system or C compiler may already have supplied
it for you (look for gc.h and libgc.a, or let the configure script
check for you).  If it can't find libgc the configure script will
provide a download link for it.  If you install it under, say,
/usr/lib/libgc.a, provide --with-gc-prefix=/usr to make it accessible
to the d2c build process.

Once you have installed a pre-built binary and checked out the source
from svn://anonsvn.gwydiondylan.org/scm/svn/dylan/gwydion, do:

  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ make
  $ make install

You can also use a separate build directory:

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ ../src/configure
  $ make
  $ make install

If the configure process complains that your platform is unsupported,
things get a little more involved.

As d2c relies on the platform's native C compiler for code generation,
building d2c can sometimes fail due to bugs in the C compiler.  In
situations such as these we recommend reducing the C compiler
optimization level by adding the --enable-debug option to the
configure command line.

RELOCATING BINARIES

If you can't install precompiled binaries into /usr/local, you can install
them elsewhere and set some appropriate environment variables. In general,
you'll need to set PATH, any variables required by your C compiler
(although d2c tries to handle this automatically), and at least one
Dylan-specific variable.

  DYLANDIR: The prefix under which Gwydion Dylan was installed. This defaults
    to /usr/local for tarballs and /usr for RPMS. Both Mindy and d2c use this
    variable to locate various files.

  DYLANPATH: The location of d2c libraries and Mindy *.dbc files. This
    defaults to "$DYLANDIR/lib/dylan/$VERSION/$PLATFORM". You won't
    normally need to set this unless you create more than one
    directory of libraries.

If you are on a platform with support for shared libraries, you'll
need to make sure the libraries are found by the runtime
linker. Details vary form system to system, but usually you need to
set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to $DYLANPATH.
  
The RPMS are allegedly relocatable. Tell us if it doesn't work.
