Gwydion Dylan for DEBIAN
----------------------

This is a Dylan programming environment, originally created by the
Computer Science department at Carnegie-Mellon University.  It 
consists of a high-performance static compiler (d2c) that is
capable of producing code approaching the efficiency of C++, and
a byte-code compiler (Mindy) that is much quicker to build, but
slower to run.

We have a lot of plans for future enhancements, but at the moment
we are working to stablize the tools, implement a Common Dylan
runtime, and grow our user base.

The how's and why of Gwydion Dylan are discussed at the website
at: http://www.gwydiondylan.org.

Note: These files contain rpath's, which are set to Debian's standard
library locations.  This will be changed in a future release.

NOTE on the DUIM Example
-------------------------
You can test the DUIM code by using the new '-d' option of
make-dylan-app.

1.  make-dylan-app -d duim-test
2.  cd into the duim-test directory and type 'make'.


You can get rudimentary fontification under GNU Emacs now, by
adding the following to your .emacs file:

(defvar dylan-mode-hook
  (lambda()
      (progn
            (dylan-install-font-lock-defaults))))

------------------------------------------------------

Enjoy Dylan! :-)
