Description: The Gwydion Dylan Runtime Environment
 This package contains the libraries and other files needed to
 run programs compiled with the Gwydion Dylan compiler (d2c).
 .
 At some point in the (hopefully near) future, this package will
 contain the Gwydion Dylan Listener, which will allow interactive
 exploration of the language.
 .

Description: Gwydion Dylan Development Tools
 CMU's Gwydion Dylan provides d2c, a Dylan-to-C batch compiler. It produces
 fairly efficient output but requires strange incantations to compile even
 simple programs. Tools for interfacing with C are included. (The Mindy
 bytecode interpreter is available as a separate package.) If you're really
 excited about writing Dylan programs for Linux--and don't mind the
 inconveniences of d2c--these are the tools to use. If you prefer a mature
 development environment, try another language.
 .
 This package contains the tools necessary to recompile d2c. They 
 include a LISP to Dylan translator, a parser generator, and various
 tools for maintaining the build tree. This package also contains a 
 few general-purpose development utilities written in Dylan.

Description: A Dylan interpreter.
 Mindy is a Dylan bytecode interpreter, originally written as part of CMU's
 Gwydion Dylan project. It compiles faster than d2c and includes much better
 debugging tools. Unfortunately, Mindy makes no attempt to run fast.
 .
 Documentation for Mindy can be found in the main gwydion-dylan package, or
 on the web at <http://www.gwydiondylan.org/>.
