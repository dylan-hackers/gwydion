This file contains credits (currently incomplete) for people who have
worked on Gwydion Dylan. It follows the same format as the Linux kernel
credits file:

	This is at least a partial credits-file of people that have
	contributed to the linux project.  It is sorted by name, and
	formatted in a format that allows for easy grepping and
	beautification by scripts.  The fields are: name (N), email (E),
	web-address (W), PGP key ID and fingerprint (P), description (D)
	and snail-mail address (S). 
	Thanks,

			Linus
