.SH NAME
Gwydion Dylan \- A collection of Dylan development tools
.SH DESCRIPTION
Gwydion Dylan is a collection of free software Dylan development tools for
Unix and GNU/Linux systems. It includes the
.IR d2c (1)
compiler, the
.IR melange (1)
interface generator and a number of other useful programs. Gwydion Dylan
was developed by the Gwydion Group at CMU with DARPA funding, and is now
maintained by a group of volunteers.
.PP
.B d2c
generates fairly good code--current development versions are about half as
good as gcc in this respect. (In fact, Gwydion Dylan uses gcc to generate
machine code, but not all of the high-level language features are fully
optimized.) The compiler and standard libraries are actually very stable,
but in need more work before they're suitable for widespread use.
.PP
Unfortunately, the compiler still runs slowly.
