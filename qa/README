These sources are a port of the Functional Objects testworks and associated
tools.  They are functionally identical, though certain features have been
commented out due to Gwydion Dylan's lack of support (e.g., benchmarking
statistics, etc.)

The sources are being distributed by the Gwydion Dylan Maintainers under
the terms of Functional Objects' "Open Source License" (a copy of which
is included in this folder.)


[Note: Moved testworks and testworks-specs to libraries/programming-tools.
