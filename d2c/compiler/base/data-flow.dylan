// Expressions:
//
//    And expression represents a fine-grain step evaluation: a constant, a
// variable, or the application of an operator to constants and variables.
// These simple expressions are combined via explicit temporary variables
// (there are no nested expressions.)
//
//    In order to make common-subexpression detection easy, expressions can be
// hash-consed: if the same expression is needed in two different locations,
// then the same == expression is used.  This means that once an expression has
// been created, it can't be modified in a way that would change the meaning of
// the expression.  This commoning isn't actually done until we do code motion,
// since the initial expressions are almost certain to change during the first
// optimize iteration.
//
