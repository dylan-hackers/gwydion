//  This file contains definitions for sorting utilities for Dylan
//  sequences.
//
//  These are the default methods for sorting sequences.  The way they work
//  is to coerce the sequence to be sorted to a vector.  This allows easier
//  access to the elements of the sequence and the use of typical sorting
//  algorithms.  When the sorting is complete, the vector is coerced back
//  to the class for copy of the original sequence.
//
//  Several simple sorting functions are defined first.  These implement
//  selection sort and insertion sort.  These two algorithms work well for
//  small sequences, but are too inefficient for large tasks.  Two more
//  efficient algorithms are also implemented: merge sort and quick sort.
//  The more efficient sorts can use the simple sorting algorithms for
//  small subsequences.  (This is controlled by the $SMALL-SORT-SIZE$
//  constant.)
//
//  One common feature of the sort functions which sort in place is the
//  keyword arguments START and END.  These keywords tell the sort function
//  which portion of the vector to operate upon.  Thus recursive calls or
//  calls to other sort functions can sort different segments of the same
//  vector through use of keys.  The START key is always an inclusive bound
//  for the beginning of the subsequence; the END key is always an
//  exclusive bound for the end of the subsequence.

//// Simple Sorting Algorithms

// swap-elements! -- internal
//
// Swaps two elements in a vector.
//

                                     key1 :: <integer>,

 => ();
  let element1 = vector[key1];
  let element2 = vector[key2];
  vector[key1] := element2;
  vector[key2] := element1;
end function swap-elements!;


// insertion-sort! -- internal
//
// Insertion sort also maintains the invariant that the vector is sorted
// up to a current position.  The next element after this position is
// inserted into the sorted part of the vector, pushing larger elements up
// if necessary.
//
// INSERTION-SORT! accepts the same keys as SELECTION-SORT!  Insertion
// sort is stable, and this method sorts the vector in place.
//

	 while: test(current-element, vector[insert-key]))
      vector[insert-key + 1] := vector[insert-key];

//// Recursive Sorting Algorithms

// $small-sort-size$ -- internal
//
// The simple sorts can be used to sort the small subsequences generated
// by the recursive algorithms.  This parameter defines how small the
// subsequence should be before the simple sorts are called.  (The simple
// sorts can be turned off by setting this to 0.)
//
define constant $small-sort-size$ :: <integer> = 15;

// Merge Sort
//
// Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm.  It divides the vector in
// half and recursively calls merge sort on the halves.  When the calls
// return, the halves are sorted, and they are merged together.
//
// Merge sort is stable.  There is a version that sorts in place, and
// modifies the original vector.  This uses a small amount of extra space
// in the process (it merges the sorted halves into a new vector and then
// copies back to the original).  There is also a version that uses as
// much extra space as it needs, and sorts non-destructively.

// merge! -- internal
//
// This function merges two contiguous sorted subsequences of a vector.
// It accepts four keyword arguments in addition to a vector.  TEST
// specifies the ascending order for the sort/merge.  START and MIDDLE
// give the beginnings of the two subsequences, and END is the end of the
// second subsequence.  (Again, START and MIDDLE are inclusive bounds for
// the subsequences, and MIDDLE and END are exclusive end bounds.  (The
// subsequences must be contiguous in the vector.))
//
// Again, merging assumes the subsequences are sorted.  Two pointers run
// down each subsequence.  The smallest of the two elements is copied to a
// merge vector and the pointer for its subsequence is incremented.  This
// continues until both pointers reach the end of the subsequences.
// Finally the merge vector is copied into the original vector in
// position.
//
define function merge!
    (vector :: <simple-object-vector>,
     test :: <function>,
     first :: <integer>,
     middle :: <integer>,
     last :: <integer>)
 => ();
  let merge-size :: <integer> = last - first;

  // BGH -- this does not need to cons!!  Can merge in-place.  Later.
  let merge-vector = make(<simple-object-vector>, size: merge-size);
  let start-key :: <integer> = first;
  let middle-key :: <integer> = middle;
  for (merge-key :: <integer> from 0 below merge-size)
    case
      start-key >= middle =>
	merge-vector[merge-key] := vector[middle-key];
        middle-key := middle-key + 1;
      middle-key >= last =>
	merge-vector[merge-key] := vector[start-key];
        start-key := start-key + 1;
      test(vector[middle-key], vector[start-key]) =>
	merge-vector[merge-key] := vector[middle-key];
        middle-key := middle-key + 1;

end function merge!;


// merge-sort! -- internal
//
// Sorts a vector in place using merge sort.  Computes the middle of the
// vector and recursively calls MERGE-SORT! on both halves.  Merges the
// halves when both calls return.  If the vector is smaller than
// $SMALL-SORT-SIZE$, however, INSERTION-SORT! is used instead.  Recursive
// calls to MERGE-SORT! terminate (by doing nothing) when the vector to be
// sorted contains only one element (or when insertion sort is used).
//
// Three keywords are accepted by this function.  The TEST specifies the
// ascending order for the sort, and START and END give the bounds of the
// subvector to be operated on in VECTOR.
//
//
// Caution: merge-sort! leaves the vector not *quite* sorted, to be
// cleaned up afterwards by insertion-sort!

  end if;
end function merge-sort!;


// Quick Sort
//
// Quick sort is also a divide-and-conquer algorithm.  It partitions the
// vector by choosing a pivot, and separating elements smaller than the
// pivot from elements larger than the pivot.  Then quick sort is called
// recursively on the two subsequences to sort them in place.  When the
// recursive calls return, the vector is sorted, because all the elements
// in the first subsequence are smaller than those in the second.
//
// Quick sort sorts in place, destructively, but it is not stable.

// median-of-three -- internal
//
// Pick the index of the pivot point by picking the index corresponding to
// median(vec[first], vec[middle], vec[last - 1]).  Note: In accordance with
// convention, "last" is an exclusive bound.
//

// partition! -- internal
//
// Partitions a vector and returns the partition position.  The pivot
// element is chosen by the median-of-three method.  Pointers are
// started at the beginning and end of the vector.  The "small" pointer
// moves forward over elements smaller than the pivot element, and stops
// at those larger.  The "large" point moves backward over elements larger
// than the pivot element, and stops at those smaller.  The two elements
// at the places where the pointers stop are swapped.  This continues
// until the pointers cross each other.  Then the small pointer is
// returned as the partition position.

// The depth-charge saves us from O(N^2) worse-case behavior.  Median-of-3
