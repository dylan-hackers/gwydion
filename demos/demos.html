<H1>Gwydion Dylan Demo Programs</H1>

These demos live in <SAMP><A HREF="">mindy/src/demos</A></SAMP> subdirectories.
 Note that in addition to the <VAR>foo</VAR><SAMP>.dylan</SAMP> file pointed
to, there is also a  <VAR>foo</VAR><SAMP>-exports.dylan</SAMP> which sets up
the module namespace and a <VAR>foo</VAR><SAMP>.lid</SAMP> which is used to
tell d2c what to compile.

Although with the exception of <SAMP>hello-world</SAMP> these demos are ordered
alphabetically rather than by complexity, this is a quasi-tutorial in that
there are various nuggets of wisdom scattered throughout.

<P>
If you have run
<SAMP>
<A HREF="http://legend.gwydion.cs.cmu.edu/gwydion/dylan/docs/htdocs/tools.html">
mk-build-tree
</A>
</SAMP>
then there will be makefiles in the demo build directories which will compile
the demos.  We don't go into too much detail here about how to build these
demos, see the documentation for 
<A HREF="http://legend.gwydion.cs.cmu.edu/gwydion/dylan/docs/maker-out/mindy.htm">mindy</A>
and

<HR>
<H2><A HREF="hello-world/hello-world.dylan" NAME=HW>hello-world</A></H2>

This is the canonical "hello, world" demo.  Type 
<PRE>
  mindycomp -lhello-world hello-world-exports.dylan
  mindycomp -lhello-world hello-world.dylan
  mindy -f hello-world-exports.dbc -f hello-world.dbc
</PRE>
to run it under mindy or:
<PRE>
  d2c hello-world.lid
  ./hello-world
</PRE>
to run it under d2c.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A HREF="cat/cat.dylan">cat</A></H2>

This program demonstrates buffered stream I/O by duplicating the UNIX (tm)
"cat" utility.  See also 
<A HREF="stream-demo/stream-demo.dylan">stream-demo</A> for more basic usage.

Usage is typical for a unix program.  It may be invoked either with a
set of files on the command line:
<PRE>
  mindy -f cat-exports.dbc -f cat.dbc file1 file2 ....
</PRE>
or with no arguments, in which case it reads from "standard input".  You may
also specify special filename "-" which will refer to the standard input.
<P>
On most Unix systems you should be able to make it into an executable
script by concatenating <SAMP>cat-exports.dbc</SAMP> and <SAMP>cat.dbc</SAMP>
into say <SAMP>mindy-cat</SAMP>, prepending the the line
<PRE>
  #<VAR>DYLANDIR</VAR>/bin/mindy -f
</PRE>
and adding "execute" to the file's protection.
Note that <VAR>DYLANDIR</VAR> must be substituted by you.
<P>
You could then simply type:
<PRE>
  mindy-cat file1 file2 ....
</PRE>
You must, of course, remember to specify the DYLANDIR environment variable so
that it points to directories containing all of the relevant libraries.  (This
demo uses only "dylan" and "streams", but the "html2txt" demo also uses 
"collection-extensions".)
<P>

<HR>
<H2><A HREF="craps/craps.dylan">craps</A></H2>
Slightly more sophisticated than hello-world, this demo makes use of the
<CODE>random</CODE> library.


<HR>
<H2><A HREF="diff/diff.dylan">diff</A></H2>

This program demonstrates the diff module of the Collection-extensions
library.  It mimics the UNIX (tm) "diff" utility.

<P>
Usage:
<PRE>
  mindy -f diff-lib.dbc file1 file2
</PRE>
<P>
<SAMP>diff-lib.dbc</SAMP> is created by the 
<A HREF="http://legend.gwydion.cs.cmu.edu/gwydion/dylan/docs/htdocs/tools.html">
Makegen
</A>
makefile by contantenating <SAMP>diff-exports.dbc</SAMP> and <SAMP>
diff.dbc</SAMP>.

Limitations: Diff the stand-alone utility is meant purely as a demo.
It doesn't support any of the options that a real diff utility does.
It accepts input only as files; it won't read from standard input.
The output format of our demo is slightly different from the
standard Unix diff.
<P>
You must, of course, remember to specify the DYLANDIR environment variable so
that it points to directories containing all of the relevant libraries.  (This
demo uses "dylan", "streams", "format", and "collection-extensions")
The build procedure is similar to 
<P>

<HR>
<H2><A HREF="html2txt/html2txt.dylan">html2txt</A></H2>

The "html2txt" program is a filter which converts text in WWWs "HyperText
Markup Language" into simple formatted text.  Although it is a complete and
useful application, it is included in this distribution primarily as a
demonstration of a "real" (albeit small) Dylan (tm) program.  Note that this
demo only understands HTML 2.0.

<P>
Usage is similar to "cat" above, except that it does not support the "-" 
argument.  You may therefore set of files on the command line or use
standard input by specifying no command line arguments
<PRE>
  mindy -f html2txt-lib.dbc file1.html file2.html ....
  mindy -f cat-lib.dbc file1.html file2.html | mindy -f html2txt-lib.dbc
</PRE>
At present, "html2txt" accepts no command line switches, although the 
behavior may be changed by changing several constant declarations towards 
the top of the source file.
<P>
A useful test case for this program is this file (<SAMP>demos.html</SAMP>).
<P>
The basic translation strategy used by html2txt is to scan the file line by
line, looking for HTML "tags" and accumulating text that lies between any
two tags.  For each tag type, there is a set of routines (stored in tables)
which define the appropriate actions for starting and ending the
"environment" defined by the tag and for dumping the collected text from
within that environment as formatted text.  A basic control loop in
"process-HTML" is responsible for calling the appropriate tag actions.
This routine may be called recusively by some of the tag actions.
<P>
The "interface" between adjacent environments is handled via the "blank"
parameter which is passed around extensively.  This variable states whether
a blank line has just been printed.  Thus environments which believe that
they must be preceded or followed by a blank line can determine whetehr
they must do anything about it, and we lessen the risk that multiple
routines will emit blank lines when we only want a maximum of one.
<P>
The primary advantage of this organization is that it allows the
specialized actions for a single tag to be grouped together, and allows new
tags to be cleanly added.  It benefits greatly from Dylan's ability to
create anonymous methods and manipulate them as first class data objects,
as well as from the rich set of available collection types.

<H2><A HREF="tk-html2txt/html2txt.dylan">HTML2TXT for TK</A></H2>

This is the same program, only now with a spiffy graphical interface.

<p> If you get the error message 'font
"-adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--12*" doesn't exist', edit
html2txt.dylan.  Find the lines that define "normal-font" and
"bold-font" and substitute a font your machine does have.
Alternately, go down a few lines further and delete the "font:
normal-font" and "font: bold-font" clauses.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A HREF="library-demo/library-demo.dylan">library-demo</A></H2>

A fairly minimal demo of creating one library (<CODE>fact</CODE>) and having
another library (<CODE>library-demo</CODE>) use it.  In the
<SAMP><A HREF="library-demo/library-demo.lid">library-demo.lid</A></SAMP>
note the use of
<CODE>Unit-Prefix:</CODE> to prevent the creation of C identifiers with hyphens
in them and in
<SAMP><A HREF="library-demo/fact.lid">fact.lid</A></SAMP>
the use of <CODE>Unique-ID-Base:</CODE> to make sure any exported classes have
unique IDs (in this case there are none.)
<P>
Under Mindy, you can run this as the other demos:
<PRE>
  mindy -f library-demo-lib.dbc
</PRE>
Note however that <SAMP>library-demo-lib.dbc</SAMP> does <EM>not</EM> include
the <CODE>Fact</CODE> library.  Instead this is demand-loaded by searching on 
<SAMP>DYLANPATH</SAMP> for <SAMP>fact-lib.dbc</SAMP> (preferrably) or
<SAMP>fact.dbc</SAMP>.  Sometimes you can get in trouble if the
<SAMP>-lib.dbc</SAMP> file doesn't appear in <SAMP>DYLANPATH</SAMP> before some
other file that happens to use the unsuffixed name.

Under d2c, all used libraries are statically linked into the executable, and
you just type:
<PRE>
  ./library-demo
</PRE>

<H2><A HREF="minesweeper/minesweeper.dylan">minesweeper</A></H2>

This is a quick and dirty imitation of Microsoft's Minesweeper game.
It has a few improvements--it can do much of the tedious work for you!
For various reasons, initializing the game board takes forever, but
play is reasonably quick once everything's set up.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A HREF="stream-demo/stream-demo.dylan">stream-demo</A></H2>

A simple use of streams for both file and terminal I/O.
