<H2>DUIM Test Suite Example Project</H2>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">

<P>Originally written as an interactive DUIM test suite, this
project is provided in the hope that it will be informative for
users.  This project demonstrates the use of virtually all of the
UI elements available in DUIM.  If you need a working example of
something you read about in the documentation or if you're
looking for a UI element but you don't know quite what it's
called, this is the place to find it.</P>

<P>The file names are intended to be suggestive of their contents.
If you can't find something, try using the Find tool in the
Functional Developer IDE to search over all the files in the project
to find what you're looking for.</P>
