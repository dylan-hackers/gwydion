//  This file contains definitions for sorting utilities for Dylan
//  sequences.
//
//  These are the default methods for sorting sequences.  The way they work
//  is to coerce the sequence to be sorted to a vector.  This allows easier
//  access to the elements of the sequence and the use of typical sorting
//  algorithms.  When the sorting is complete, the vector is coerced back
//  to the class for copy of the original sequence.
//
//  Several simple sorting functions are defined first.  These implement
//  selection sort and insertion sort.  These two algorithms work well for
//  small sequences, but are too inefficient for large tasks.  Two more
//  efficient algorithms are also implemented: merge sort and quick sort.
//  The more efficient sorts can use the simple sorting algorithms for
//  small subsequences.  (This is controlled by the $SMALL-SORT-SIZE$
//  constant.)
//
//  One common feature of the sort functions which sort in place is the
//  keyword arguments START and END.  These keywords tell the sort function
//  which portion of the vector to operate upon.  Thus recursive calls or
//  calls to other sort functions can sort different segments of the same
//  vector through use of keys.  The START key is always an inclusive bound
//  for the beginning of the subsequence; the END key is always an
//  exclusive bound for the end of the subsequence.

//// Simple Sorting Algorithms

// swap-elements! -- internal
//
// Swaps two elements in a vector.
//
define method swap-elements! (vector :: <vector>, key1 :: <integer>,
			      key2 :: <integer>)
  let element1 = vector[key1];
  let element2 = vector[key2];
  vector[key1] := element2;
  vector[key2] := element1;
end method swap-elements!;

// selection-sort! -- internal
//
// Selection sort sorts the vector from the beginning to the end.  At any
// point the vector is sorted up to a certain position.  From this
// position the remainder of the vector is searched for the next largest
// element, and this element is moved to the position.  After this has
// been done for each position in the vector, the vector is sorted.
//
// SELECTION-SORT! takes a TEST key to specify the ascending order or
// elements, a START key to specify where in the vector to begin the sort,
// and an END key to specify where to end the sort.  (As usual in Dylan,
// START is an inclusive bound while END is an exclusive bound.)
//
// Selection sort is NOT stable, but it does sort in place.
//
define method selection-sort!(vector :: <vector>,
			      #key test = \<, start: first = 0,
			           end: last)
  let last = last | size(vector);

    for (search-key from current-key + 1 below last,
	 select-key = current-key
	   then if (test(vector[search-key], vector[select-key])) search-key
		else select-key
		end if)
    finally
      swap-elements!(vector, current-key, select-key)
    end for;
  end for;
  vector;
end method selection-sort!;

// selection-sort -- internal
//
// This version of selection sort does not modify the original vector.  It
// calls the destructive version on copy of the vector.
//
define method selection-sort (vector :: <vector>,
			      #key test = \<, start: first = 0, end: last)
  let sort-vector = copy-sequence(vector, start: first, end: last);
  selection-sort!(sort-vector, test: test);
end method selection-sort;

// insertion-sort! -- internal
//
// Insertion sort also maintains the invariant that the vector is sorted
// up to a current position.  The next element after this position is
// inserted into the sorted part of the vector, pushing larger elements up
// if necessary.
//
// INSERTION-SORT! accepts the same keys as SELECTION-SORT!  Insertion
// sort is stable, and this method sorts the vector in place.
//
define method insertion-sort!(vector :: <vector>,
			      #key test = \<, start: first = 0, end: last)
  let last = last | size(vector);
  for (current-key from first + 1 below last)
    let current-element = vector[current-key];
    for (insert-key from current-key - 1 to first by -1,
	 while: test(current-element, vector[insert-key]))
      vector[insert-key + 1] := vector[insert-key];
    finally
      vector[insert-key + 1] := current-element;
    end for;
  end for;
  vector;
end method insertion-sort!;

// insertion-sort -- internal
//
// This version of insertion sort does not modify the original vector.  It
// calls the destructive version on copy of the vector.

//// Recursive Sorting Algorithms

// $small-sort-size$ -- internal
//
// The simple sorts can be used to sort the small subsequences generated
// by the recursive algorithms.  This parameter defines how small the
// subsequence should be before the simple sorts are called.  (The simple
// sorts can be turned off by setting this to 0.)
//
define variable $small-sort-size$ = 10;

// Merge Sort
//
// Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm.  It divides the vector in
// half and recursively calls merge sort on the halves.  When the calls
// return, the halves are sorted, and they are merged together.
//
// Merge sort is stable.  There is a version that sorts in place, and
// modifies the original vector.  This uses a small amount of extra space
// in the process (it merges the sorted halves into a new vector and then
// copies back to the original).  There is also a version that uses as
// much extra space as it needs, and sorts non-destructively.

// merge! -- internal
//
// This function merges two contiguous sorted subsequences of a vector.
// It accepts four keyword arguments in addition to a vector.  TEST
// specifies the ascending order for the sort/merge.  START and MIDDLE
// give the beginnings of the two subsequences, and END is the end of the
// second subsequence.  (Again, START and MIDDLE are inclusive bounds for
// the subsequences, and MIDDLE and END are exclusive end bounds.  (The
// subsequences must be contiguous in the vector.))
//
// Again, merging assumes the subsequences are sorted.  Two pointers run
// down each subsequence.  The smallest of the two elements is copied to a
// merge vector and the pointer for its subsequence is incremented.  This
// continues until both pointers reach the end of the subsequences.
// Finally the merge vector is copied into the original vector in
// position.
//
define method merge!(vector :: <vector>,
		     #key test: test, start: first, middle: middle, end: last)
  let merge-size = last - first;
  let merge-vector = make(<vector>, size: merge-size);
  let start-key = first;

    case
      start-key >= middle =>
	merge-vector[merge-key] := vector[middle-key];

	merge-vector[merge-key] := vector[start-key];
        start-key := start-key + 1;

	merge-vector[merge-key] := vector[middle-key];
        middle-key := middle-key + 1;
      otherwise =>
	merge-vector[merge-key] := vector[start-key];

// merge-sort! -- internal
//
// Sorts a vector in place using merge sort.  Computes the middle of the
// vector and recursively calls MERGE-SORT! on both halves.  Merges the
// halves when both calls return.  If the vector is smaller than
// $SMALL-SORT-SIZE$, however, INSERTION-SORT! is used instead.  Recursive
// calls to MERGE-SORT! terminate (by doing nothing) when the vector to be
// sorted contains only one element (or when insertion sort is used).
//
// Three keywords are accepted by this function.  The TEST specifies the
// ascending order for the sort, and START and END give the bounds of the
// subvector to be operated on in VECTOR.

// merge -- internal
//
// This non-destructive version of MERGE merges two vectors as does

// vector is simply returned, rather than copied into any of the

// This works the same as MERGE-SORT!, except that the recursive calls
// terminate by returning a new vector rather than by changing the old.
// Thus, the recursion might terminate when the vector to be sorted
// contains less than two elements, and a call to COPY-SEQUENCE is
// returned; or when the insertion sort kicks in.  The non-destructive
// version of insertion sort is used.
//
// MERGE-SORT still takes the keywords START and END, because the
// recursive calls are still made on two halves of the same vector.  (The
// halves of the vector are not copied before the calls.)

// Quick Sort
//
// Quick sort is also a divide-and-conquer algorithm.  It partitions the
// vector by choosing a pivot, and separating elements smaller than the
// pivot from elements larger than the pivot.  Then quick sort is called
// recursively on the two subsequences to sort them in place.  When the
// recursive calls return, the vector is sorted, because all the elements
// in the first subsequence are smaller than those in the second.
//
// Quick sort sorts in place, destructively, but it is not stable.

// median-of-three -- internal

// median(vec[first], vec[middle], vec[last - 1]).  Note: In accordance with
// convention, "last" is an exclusive bound.
